Changes from 1.2 to 1.3
 1) Fix support for importing in Python 2.5 on Windows. The module now uses the
    .pyd extension instead of the .dll extension since support for importing
    modules with the .dll extension was removed in Python 2.5.
 2) Add support for 64-bit Python installations, particularly in Python 2.5.

Changes from 1.1 to 1.2
 1) Changed macros to support building with the Microsoft compiler as
    requested by Christopher Mioni.
 2) Added keywords arguments for the StartLogging() method as requested by
    Christopher Mioni.
 3) Use __DATE__ and __TIME__ to determine the date and time of the build
    rather than passing it through directly.
 4) Added support for getting a file object for the file that is currently
    being logged to or None if no logging is taking place.


Changes from 1.0 to 1.1
 1) Raise an exception if a write fails during logging.
 2) Add module constants version and buildtime in order to aid in support and
    debugging.
